##Who Am I?

Hello there! My name is Shom Mazumder and I use data to tackle interesting questions. As of now, I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University. To see my academic work, head over [here](http://scholar.harvard.edu/smazumder). In the past, I have either been affiliated with or worked at the following places:

* [NPR](http://npr.org)
* [Palantir Technologies](https://palantir.com)
* [Georgetown University School of Foreign Service](https://sfs.georgetown.edu)

##Why Am I Here?

Aside from this website being a manifestation of my digital self, I want to use this space to experiment with ideas and data problems that have been floating around in my head.

If you're working on (or thinking about) cool projects that involve data and you find yourself in the Cambridge/Boston area, I'd love to grab coffee and chat. Send me an [email](mailto:smazumder@g.harvard.edu) or shoot me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shom_mazumder) and I'll do my best to make it happen.

## How Did the Sausage Get Made?

To build this site and produce content found therein, I used the following tools:

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)--a Ruby gem that makes generating static websites (relatively) painless
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host the site for free!
* [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com)--an amazing text editor to write beautiful code
* [LaTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/)--an IDE for document typesetting
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)--an IDE for data analysis in R
* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)--an awesome JavaScript library for creating dynamic data visualizations

Additionally, I borrowed the theme for this website from [MadeMistakes](https://mademistakes.com/). As time goes on, I'll experiment with new stuff to make this website's theme more suitable for scholars, programmers, and data scientists who want to build an online portfolio.
