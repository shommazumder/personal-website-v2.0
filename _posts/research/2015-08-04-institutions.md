##International Law

###Can I Stay a BIT Longer? The Effect of Bilateral Investment Treaties on Leader Survival
[*Link to PDF*]({{site.url}}/files/BIT-Survival.pdf)

I show that the institutions enshrined in Bilateral Investment Treaties \(BITs\)--namely, international courts--can empower autocrats. In particular, I argue that when international institutions substitute for domestic ones, autocrats may stand to gain from the reduced incentive to empower the host country's property rights institutions. Using a variety of statistical methods including Cox Hazards regressions and matching methods to reduce covariate imbalance, I find autocrats who sign more BITS tend to have lower hazards of being removed from office.

###Precedential Power: The Role of the United States in Shaping International Law at the WTO
[*Link to PDF*]({{site.url}}/files/WTO-Precedent-Draft.pdf)

International trade law, though explicitly denied, implicitly relies on a well-functioning system of precedent. Because of its public-good character, states have incentive to undersupply the socially optimal amount of precedent. I argue that the United States takes on the burden of supplying precedent at the World Trade Organization \(WTO\), but it does so in a way that is consistent with its individual interests. Using a Bayesian statistical framework, I find evidence for a number of empirical implications of my argument.

###Text Analysis of International Law \(with [Eric Arias](https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/ericarias/)\)
An increasing amount of international law manifests itself on paper. In this project, we seek to characterize the evolution of international law within and across various regimes \(eg, trade, investment, and human rights\) and the consequences that they may have on state behavior. To do this, we utilize a number of techniques from the field of text analysis and natural language processing. 

###Reforming International Institutions: The Case of the WTO
International institutions are generally governed by sets of rules, but these rules are rarely a product of consensus. Under what conditions do states contest these rules? In this project, I use data from the WTO's meetings and minutes to test hypotheses derived from the rational design literature. 

##Conflict and Cooperation

###Autocracies and the International Sources of Cooperation
[*Link to PDF*]({{site.url}}/files/pta-conflict.pdf)

Recently, a number of scholars have begun unpacking variation in an autocracies to challenge the conventional wisdom on the Democratic Peace. In this paper, I show that variation in an autocracy's involvement with international institutions can also explain their ability to peacefully settle disputes. I find that autocrats who are more embedded in the Preferential Trade Agreement \(PTA\) regime tend to initiate disputes less often than their less embedded counterparts and that this effect is likely resultant of the informational effects of the PTA regime.
