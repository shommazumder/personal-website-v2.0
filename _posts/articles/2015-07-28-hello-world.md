Hey, my name is Shom Mazumder and I'm a graduate student in the Department of Government at [Harvard University](http://scholar.harvard.edu/smazumder). I decided to start up a blog so I could share my thoughts on interesting stuff going on in the world. Particularly, I'm going to use this space for two main things: 

   1. Experimenting with learning new types of techniques related to machine learning, statistics, data visualization, and data science-y type things

   2. Writing about half-baked ideas and cool stuff that people are working on in the academic world (and beyond)
